Chapter 2. Preliminaries
------------------------

This chapter describes whatever the user needs to know to
understand your work. That could be the syntax and semantics of
temporal logics, the definition of X.509, or how internet routing
works.

You have a chance here to show your advisor that you have looked
beyond the assignment that you were given. However, take care that
everything you describe is relevant. Do your best to describe how
the definitions you give are relevant to the thesis.

Chapter 2 does not contain anything new!
