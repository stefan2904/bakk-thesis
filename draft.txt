- Introduction

- [PGP] openPGP
-- History
-- Principles
--- Confidentiality (Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption)
---  Integrity (Message Signing)
--- Authentication (Trust / Web of Trust)
-- Applications
--- Mail (PGP/Mime?)
--- TLS (RFC 6091)
--- Data storage?
-- (Popular) Implementations
--- PGP
--- GPG / Gpg4win
--- BouncyCastle
--- APG
--- ...
-- Similar protocols
--- S/MIME

- [PGP] Concerns (?)
-- key sizes (NIST, ECRYPT, BSI, via http://www.keylength.com/en/compare/)
-- outdated cipher ?
-- outdaten hash-algos ?
-- elliptic curve cryptography ?
