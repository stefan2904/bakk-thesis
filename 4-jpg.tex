\section{Implementation security}

Security concerns, as long as they affect the actual design of the openPGP standard, are discussed in \citep{RFC4880}. In the following chapter, we summarize this concerns and discuss how they effect our implementation. We are closing with a 	short overview over countermeasures we implemented in our implementation.
