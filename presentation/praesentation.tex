\section{Problem Statement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% snowden trying to mail with greenwald -> gchq, nsa, china ... listening
% cloud in between? secret service?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% me trying to mail with customer -> konkurenz listening
% cloud in between? internet routing via england?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% hospital trying to mail with client -> employer listening
% gmail in between?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% slide which explains why we need privacy (even if we have nothing to hide?)
% explain why ssl is not enough => gmail == google, nsa has access, wirtschaftsspionage, etc

\end{frame}

% short extra slide?
% we need confidential, integrity, authentizity.
% end to end
% pgp provides that

\section{openPGP}

\begin{frame}
\note{
	 Zimmermann: anti-nuclear activist \\
	 PGP: invented to store message on message boards	
}
\frametitle{PGP History}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pretty Good Privacy
	\item 1991: PGP created by Phil Zimmermann 
	\item \textit{most widely used email encryption software in the world}
	\item 1998: PGP 5 standardized: \textbf{OpenPGP (RFC 4880)}
	\item 2010: PGP assets sold to Symantec for \$ 300.000.000 (Enterprise Security Group)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}

% explain what gpg is, what pgp is, what openpgp is and what jog is (bouncycastle, too)

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Standard: openPGP (RFC 4880 et al.)
		\item Implementations:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item PGP (Zimmermann, Symantec)
		\item GnuPG / GPG (GNU)
		\item APG (Android)
		\item End-to-end (Google, Chrome)
		\item Bouncycastle (Java)
		\item \textit{Java Privacy Guard} (IAIK-JCE)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}

% again, slide with snowden & greenwald + cloud + secret services

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% adding gpg: 
% snowden knows its greenwald
% snowden know message not changed
% nsa does not know what they write
% BUT: nsa knows (possibly) THAT they write -> TOR solves that?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% summing up, pgp provides confidential, integrity, authentizity
% but not anonymity (metadata)

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% how does pgp do that? -> explain encryption (confidentiality)

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% how does pgp do that? -> explain message signing (integrity)

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% so... pgp == s/mime ???

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

% NO! => explain authentizy => web of trust
% advantages: does not need ca, everyone is ca
% dissadvantages: social graph public (again: no anonymity!), how secure is a ca? usability?
% concusio: bussines vs private? central vs decentral

\end{frame}
