abstract = {OpenPGP is a standard consisting of methods for key management, digital signatures, encryption, and data formats. It is currently defined by RFC 4880 with several extensions. It is mainly utilized for sending end-to-end signed and encrypted emails to allow confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity between sender and recipient. Its cryptography and key management has been proven to be resistant against modern active attackers and was required by Edward Snowden to allow secure communications with him. While man-in-the-middle attacks against TLS connections are easy after infiltrating a certificate authority, OpenPGP provides a more decentralized approach to key distribution and authenticity between originator and sender. The most common implementations are the open-source command-line program gpg written in C, its corresponding user interfaces like Enigmail, and the Bouncy Castle library written in Java. With Symantec Encryption Desktop and Symantec Encryption Server, two well developed proprietary implementations exist, too. While the OpenPGP standard keeps its promises and has a sound message syntax and well thought out formats, it also has some weak points.},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper reveals issues and applications of anonymity and authenticity in the cloud. It outlines common privacy settings of five web browsers, anonymous browsing on the Tor network and standard methods for verifying the integrity of files obtained in the cloud. Findings: Cloud computing is an emerging technology for libraries which must balance the convenience of ubiquitous access against the potential risks for loss of anonymity and authenticity. Originality/value: This article contributes to the body of literature on user privacy and data preservation in the cloud and their impact on the library community. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

@article{Milo2011,
abstract = {We describe the implementation, based on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) for Graphics Processing Units (GPU), of a novel and very effective approach to quickly test passphrases used to protect private keyrings of OpenPGP cryptosystems. Our combination of algorithm and implementation, reduces the time required to test a set of possible passphrases by three-orders of magnitude with respect to an attack based on the procedure described in the OpenPGP standard and implemented by software packages like GnuPG, and a tenfold speed up if compared to our highly tuned CPU implementation. Our solution can be considered a replacement and an extension of pgpcrack, a utility used in the past for attacking PGP. The optimizations described can be applied to other cryptosystems and confirm that the GPU architecture is also very effective for running applications that make extensive (if not exclusive) use of integer operations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted our analysis on a recent data set with a focus on determining properties like usefulness and robustness. To this end, we analyzed graph topology, identified the strongly connected com- ponents and derived properties like verifiability of keys, signature chain lengths and redundant signature paths for nodes. Contrary to earlier works, our analysis revealed the Web of Trust to be only similar to a scale-free network, with different properties regarding the hub structure and its influence on overall connectivity. We also analyzed the commu- nity structure of theWeb of Trust and mapped it to social relationships. Finally, we present statistics which cryptographic algorithms are in use and give recommendations.},

@article{Whitten1999,
abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},
