\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chapter:conclusion}

In this thesis we presented the \textit{OpenPGP Message Format}. We have discussed its functionality and security. We have shown how OpenPGP uses asymmetric cryptography to provide a secure key- and message-exchange over insecure networks. Furthermore we discussed the trust model of OpenPGP, the \textit{Web of Trust}. We have shown how it can be used to authenticate the sender of a message.

In addition we have shown how we used the structures defined in the \textit{OpenPGP Message Format} standard to implement OpenPGP using the Java programming language and \myacro{IAIK-JCE}.
